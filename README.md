# Glass Cannon Run

This Noita mod gives you the glass cannon perk at the beginning of the game. Chaos ensues.

## How to install

1. Go to Noita's properties tab in Steam and open the beta tab. Make sure you're on the noita mods beta branch.
2. Your game's install folder ( e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita ) will now have a tools_modding folder in it. Open the readme file from that folder and follow its instructions.
3. Download this repository as a zip file ( [Download Here](https://github.com/kylepaulsen/Noita-Mod-Glass-Cannon-Run/archive/master.zip) ) and extract the directory in the zip to the mods folder in your game's install directory.
4. Start the game and open the pause menu. There should be a mods button you can click.
5. In the mods menu, click on mods to enable/disable them.

You will have to start a new game after doing all of this in order for the game to register the mods.
